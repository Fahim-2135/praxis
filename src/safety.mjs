// Pure safety classifier for the PreToolUse gate (PRAXIS.md §7, §12).
//
// This is SEPARATE from normalize.mjs on purpose. The normalizer collapses argument noise to
// count *habits* — `git push --force-with-lease` becomes `git_push`, `rm -rf x` becomes
// `unmatched`. That is exactly the wrong granularity for safety: the danger lives in the flags
// the normalizer throws away. So the safety gate recognizes the irreversible COMMAND directly,
// on its raw text, before anything runs — and classification feeds an "ask" confirmation, never
// a silent execution.
//
// Coverage is conservative and high-precision (the same philosophy as normalization, PRAXIS.md
// §5): it targets the spec's three irreversible categories — history-rewriting pushes,
// destructive deletions, and external sends — plus a few disk destroyers. Unknown commands are
// NOT flagged (the gate defaults to allow); the list grows as real dangerous commands are
// observed. A gate that over-blocks is one users learn to ignore, which is worse than one they
// trust. Because the decision is "ask" (one confirmation), erring slightly toward flagging is
// cheap — a false positive costs a keystroke, a false negative costs an irreversible action.
